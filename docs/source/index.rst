Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SDUCloud have been developed  at the eScience Center at the University Of
Southern Denmark as part of the NSAS project. Its components are provided by the
open source community. 

The purpose was to crete a protoype for a private cloud solution taylored for
research. The prototype provides a user interface to the national supercomputing
service Abacus2.0, thus improving the usability of the HPC environment for the
common user. At the same time it provides cloud storage that secures the data in
compliance with GDPR. One of the overall goals was to improve the searchability
for data. This is done by adding metadata to the stored files in SDUCloud. The
metadata (data about data) are made searchable within the SDUCloud user
interface, but other search engines can be attached to SDUCloud's metadata
service. Another example of the implementation of "Open Access" is the
integration to Zenodo_.
